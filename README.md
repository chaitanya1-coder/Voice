## Voice

# Purpose:
Voice is the next generation video conferrencing app that provides an interface where deaf and non-deaf people can easily understand sign language in real-time.

# Usage & Current Functionality:
To use the application is simple - During video calls, they have to point the camera to the sign language speaker, and the application will output the text in real time. Users will be able to translate sign language anytime anywhere.

# Video Calling Screen :
This page allows to record and convert american sign language shown by a person into text that other users on call can read it in real time. 

# Install dependencies and run on your local machine :

# Future Scope of the project :
Right now this project can convert sign language into text only, Our goal is to convert this text into audio (Voice). We believe with consistency, we may add a reverse convertion feature as well, which will convert voice to sign languange with some graphs and picture representation.
